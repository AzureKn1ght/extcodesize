# extcodesize

**Q: Create 3 smart contracts with the below functions**

Level: Medium 

1.  **First smart contract**   
    Create a function to check if the “msg.sender” is a contract address or a non-smart contract address by using “extcodesize” function. This is to protect the smart contract from being interacted by other smart contract.  
     
2.  **Second smart contract**   
    Create a smart contract to interact with the first contract but it will fail due to the check function of the first contract.  
     
3.  **Third smart contract**   
    Create a smart contract to interact with first smart contract and successfully passes the check function of the first contract.

Deploy all the smart contracts to the Ethereum Testnet (Ropsten/Rinkeby)
