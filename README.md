# extcodesize

**Q: Create 3 smart contracts with the below functions** 

Level: Medium 

*   First smart contract: 

> Create a function to check if the “msg.sender” is a contract address or a non-smart contract address by using “extcodesize” function. This is to protect the smart contract from being interacted by other smart contract. 

*   Second smart contract: Create a smart contract to interact with the first contract but it will fail due to the check function of the first contract.
*   Third smart contract: Create a smart contract to interact with first smart contract and successfully passes the check function of the first contract.
*   Deploy all the smart contracts to the Ethereum Testnet (Ropsten/Rinkeby)
*   Verify the source code in Etherscan.
