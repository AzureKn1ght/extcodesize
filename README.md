# extcodesize

**Q: Create 3 smart contracts with the below functions**

Level: Medium 

*   **First smart contract**

> Create a function to check if the “msg.sender” is a contract address or a non-smart contract address by using “extcodesize” function. This is to protect the smart contract from being interacted by other smart contract.

*   **Second smart contract**

> Create a smart contract to interact with the first contract but it will fail due to the check function of the first contract.

*   **Third smart contract**

> Create a smart contract to interact with first smart contract and successfully passes the check function of the first contract.

Deploy all the smart contracts to the Ethereum Testnet (Ropsten/Rinkeby)

Verify the source code in Etherscan.
